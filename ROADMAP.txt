roadmap for potential features and capabilities'

1. Regexes and detection
    - 1) we need to improve and make more endpoint regular expressions
    - 2) we should try to find more detection methods (like the one in js-miner)
    - 3) make more credential endpoints
2. Documentation and Release
    - 1) Simply just add documentation on the github
    - 2) Start versioning our updates and make sure code doesn't have unimportant notes
3. Options
    - 1) The user should have more versatility when it comes to output: they should have the option to use JSON or simple line output
